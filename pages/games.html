                    <div class="grid-text">
                        In its natural state, Ditto is a light-purple or pink blob-like Pokémon with vestigial facial features. 
                        It is often referred to as amorphous, but has a relatively consistent appearance in official artwork, 
                        including two small nubs on its "head", a few soft lumps at its base, and two pseudopod-like protrusions in place of arms. 
                        The face consists of beady eyes and a simple mouth; almost always pulled into a smile.
                        Ditto bears a variety of unusual and often entirely unique traits that set it apart from every other Pokémon.
                        It is capable of transforming into an exact replica of any physical object or living creature, including its form and abilities.
                        Each Ditto has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to transforming;
                        being unable to remain transformed while laughing and getting details of its transformation wrong if based on memory being apparently universal.
                        The Pocket Monsters Carddass Trading Cards depict Ditto being able to transform separate sections of its body into parts from multiple Pokémon at once.
                        The anime, TCG, and some spin-off games have shown that occasionally Ditto cannot change its face during transformation; 
                        a trait that has become synonymous with the species despite being incongruous with their depiction in core series games.

                        <div class="grid-text">
                            Togepi is a small, light-yellow Pokémon with a rounded, egg-shaped body. After hatching from its Egg,
                            Togepi's body remains encased in its eggshell. That shell has a white base color, and rounded,
                            mostly unfilled shapes (with thick borders that are either red or blue) dot the shell on all sides. 
                            Sticking out of its shell, Togepi has stubby, rounded cone arms and round feet with two toes each. 
                            Togepi has thin, black, oval eyes with thin, black arcs on their outer sides. Its head has five round-tipped,
                            conical spikes that seem to form a crown. It also has semi-oval, brown pads on the soles of its feet.
                            The anime has shown that it can retract into its shell, which it usually does to sleep.
                            It is able to siphon the positive energy of others, storing that happiness in its shell,
                            and then release it to those in need of it. Togepi is able to release poison from the spikes on its head.
                            It has a very joyful nature. As a result, it is said that it shares its joy with those who take care of it.
                            Because of its disposition, Togepi is seen as a sign of good luck, especially if a Trainer is capable of getting a sleeping Togepi to stand.
                            Togepi's innocent smile is said to calm the soul. It is also shown in the anime that Togepi can act very maliciously at times,
                            causing havoc and bad luck to its enemies. Although it is rare in the wild, Togepi can most commonly be found living within the forests.                    </div>

                            Chimchar is a bipedal Pokémon resembling a chimpanzee.
                            Its fur is primarily a shade of orange, although its face, outer ears, underbelly, hands, and feet are light yellow.
                            Its ears are large in comparison to its head, and has red insides.
                            It also has red markings around its eyes, as well as two pointed teeth in its upper jaw, a swirl-like symbol on its chest,
                            and five fingers on its hands with three toes on its feet. It has a swirly crest of hair on its head. Its rear has a small,
                            round, red patch that is usually obscured by flames produced by burning gas in its stomach.
                            These flames cannot be put out by rain, although they go out when Chimchar goes to sleep, and burn weakly when it feels ill.
                            In the past, this flame on its rear has caused people to mistake it for an apparition, dubbed the "Lantern-Tail".
                            Chimchar is very agile, being able to climb the rocky ledges of tall mountains where it lives.

                        the young pirate follows her deceased mother's footsteps by becoming the captain of a ship with her crew of pirates,
                        who all respect her deeply despite that she is much younger than them. Even though Tetra has a tendency to act tomboyish,
                        take challenges head-on, and even act bossy and cold-hearted sometimes, she actually has a kind and caring personality.

                            His true form is that of a large white whale, but he initially appears to Link as an old man on Mercay Island,
                            where he helps him begin his quest by introducing him to Ciela. He is able to control the flow of time.

                        Anjean was also a very close friend with Tetra after she met her shortly after the feisty pirate arrived to the land that would become the next Hyrule.
                        As a result of their strong friendship, Anjean gave Tetra the sacred instrument known as the Spirit Flute,
                        but only under the condition that she and her descendants would use it to protect the land.

                            Cole is a government official in the kingdom of Hyrule and the secondary antagonist of Spirit Tracks.
                            He is also a servant of Princess Zelda, the country's matriarch.
                            Chancellor Cole is a small man dressed in green attire befitting a member of the kingdom's government and is revealed to wear two green top-hats on top of his head (which are later revealed to hide two horns).
                            The Chancellor appears to be an adviser of sorts to the princess and seems to act as a sort of guardian to her as well
                            (similarly to Minister Potho in The Minish Cap), as it is revealed that he does not like her leaving Hyrule Castle unattended.
                            This creates problems when Zelda wishes to leave the castle due to her distrust of Cole's intentions.
                            Zelda secretly slips Link a note with directions to her private quarters and warning him to beware of Cole.
                            Shortly after the graduation ceremony for Link, Cole sarcastically suggests that the latter take the time to polish his train
                             before ominously hinting at the imminent disappearance of the Spirit Tracks.
                             In her quarters, Zelda confides her suspicions of Cole in Link and requests that he take her in secret to 
                             the Tower of Spirits to investigate the disappearance of the Spirit Tracks.

                            Byrne is a servant of Cole, as well as the Boss of the final floor of the Tower of Spirits.
                            When Byrne was younger, he was an apprentice of Anjean, at the Tower of Spirits.
                            He desired power, and wished that the good spirits would grant it to him.
                            When he found that nothing he did granted the power he desired, he left.
                            He decided to become even more powerful than the spirits, and the only being with that kind of strength was Malladus.
                            Thus, he began working with Chancellor Cole to resurrect the ancient demon

                        Fi is a humanoid spirit residing inside the Goddess Sword, which would eventually become the Master Sword.
                        In Skyward Sword, She serves as Link's partner and guides him during his adventure.
                        The goddess Hylia created the Goddess Sword and Fi, an intelligent humanoid spirit who resides in the Sword,
                        and gave them the purpose of assisting Hylia's Chosen Hero in fulfilling his destiny of defeating Demise.
                        She then enshrined the Sword inside the Statue of the Goddess before raising it into The Sky as part of Skyloft.
                        Preceding the Wing Ceremony, Fi appears to Link in his dreams, foretelling his destiny.
                        After Link and Zelda are attacked by a black tornado, Link wakes up in his room, where he hears Fi speaking to him.
                        Fi guides him to the Statue of the Goddess, further explaining his fate as the chosen hero and encouraging him
                        to draw the Goddess Sword from its pedestal so that Fi can formally acknowledge him as her Master.

                            is the family name of several female members of the Sheikah
                            a mysterious tribe that has served and protected the Royal Family of Hyrule for many generations.
                            Many Sheikah of the name so far have been associated with and taken on the role of accompanying
                            an incarnation of Zelda, being like a bodyguard or attendant of sorts.
                            Impa appears as one of the chosen guardians of the goddess Hylia, who is tasked with watching over Demise in the form of The Imprisoned.
                            Impa is a loyal and dedicated guardian and servant to the goddess and states that she gladly will take on the duty
                            In the final days of her life following a fierce battle with the Demon King Demise,
                            the goddess ordered Impa to enter a Gate of Time to the far future to protect her eventual mortal incarnation
                            and to help her remember her former life

                            Ghirahim is a figure of authority in the land below Skyloft, and he thinks quite highly of himself,
                            preferring to be called Lord Ghirahim. His main objective is continuously hunting for Zelda,
                            in order to use her spirit as a goddess for his plan to resurrect his master, Demise.
                            Although at first Ghirahim thinks little of Link and his presence,
                            the Demon Lord grows frustrated and erratic as he realizes the young hero is an obstacle to his plans.
                            He is portrayed as a flamboyant, seemingly calm and overconfident individual whose only goal
                            is to capture Zelda and use her to revive Demise, his master.
                            His mannerisms are exaggerated and theatrical, speaking in an eloquent and flashy style when addressing others.
                            Ghirahim is also conceited and vain when it comes to flaunting his own appearance,
                            which he regards as "stunning," "exquisite," and "pure." He acts formally and politely towards Link,
                            at first claiming to be "uncivil" since he had not yet properly introduced himself to the young hero when they first met.
                            Despite this, he is not above insulting others and calling them juvenile names, mocking them at any chance he gets.
                            Since he considers himself to be superior to humans and an honorable fighter,
                            he at first chooses not to murder Link immediately, as it would be unfair for the young hero.
                            Nonetheless, Ghirahim enjoys toying with others and making them suffer until he has been satisfied
